 %- Euler says : "there is nothing in the world that does not coming without willing to minimize or maximize something".\\

- "Since a fabric of universe is most perfect, and is the work of a most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever\\takes place in the universe in which some form of maximum and minimum does not appear"

  - As world becomes more complex and competitive, scientists, engineers, economists must take decisions more effectively, which has less cost and best value (benefit), And that's what called optimization problem.\\

    - Optimization is process by which the optimal solution, or optimum, is produced. The word \textit{optimum} has come from the Latin word \textit{optimum}, meaning best \cite{foulds2012optimization}, And Man always strived for what which is best, since the beginning of his existence. There has been a host of contributions, from Archemedes to the present.

  %- Many problems from different sectors such as the economic sector, industrial sector,... can be seen as combinatorial optimization problems: problem of choice of investments, problem of choice of objects according to selection criteria in several sets. These real problems can generally be modeled in the form of an objective function, subject to a set of constraints\cite{fawzia2016contribution}.\\ 
   %- we face some problems which might have more then one solution. In this case we have to select the best one to minimize the cost or maximize the value of this problem.\\
 %- In our daily life we face some problems which might have several solutions
